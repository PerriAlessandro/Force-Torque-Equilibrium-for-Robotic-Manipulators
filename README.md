# Force-Torque-Equilibrium-for-Robotic-Manipulators
This repository contains code for completing two exercises in force/torque equilibrium for robotic manipulators. This fundamental concept is crucial for dynamic control and is covered in this assignment.

The exercises involve two different types of robotic manipulators, each with a different joint configuration. The goal is to find the vector of generalized actuator forces required for equilibrium.

To assist with completing the exercises, two CAD models were created using Autodesk's Fusion360 software. One model corresponds to each exercise.

The MATLAB code for the project is stored in the folder Matlab code and datafiles.

For more information on the exercises, the CAD models, and the MATLAB code, please see the accompanying PDF report: Report.pdf.

## Getting Started
To complete the exercises, you will need to have a working knowledge of force/torque equilibrium and robotic manipulators. You will also need to have access to MATLAB software.

For detailed instructions on how to complete the exercises and use the CAD models, please refer to the PDF report.

## About the Project
This assignment was completed as part of a course on robotic manipulators. The goal was to gain a better understanding of force/torque equilibrium and its importance for dynamic control.

The MATLAB code and CAD models were developed by Alessandro Perri. For more information on the project, please see the PDF report.
